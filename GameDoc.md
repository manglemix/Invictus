# Setting
All players are astronauts who are settling into the first base on the moon in an alternate universe, under the mission name: Invictus. A mysterious asteroid shower damages the habitat, rendering the oxygen recycler unusable. These asteroids contain a virus that infects a few astronauts, slowly turning them aggressive. Regardless of what happens, the humans must fix the oxygen recycler within 5 days.

# Goal
The humans want to fix the oxygen recycler before they suffocate. The infected want to kill all humans, one way or another. If the oxygen recycler cannot be repaired in time, the players want to escape without any infected.

# Setup
Players should ideally sit in a circle. Each player gets a role from the app. Non-players can watch the game unfold from the host computer. In general, players cannot show any information from their device.

# Roles
All players, regardless of being infected, are engineers that can repair the oxygen recycler.
One non-infected player is the designated survivor and has the 4-digit escape code in a biometrically locked drive. They are allowed to share this code.

# Gameplay
## Repairing the Oxygen Recycler
The game is divided into days, and each day has a morning, midday, and night.

Each morning, players will see an image of their room if they were not defending someone the night before. When they have memorized it, they can leave.
Designated survivors also have a choice of hiding the escape code somewhere. If they do not, it will be placed somewhere random.

However, the vote timer will always start. Players collaboratively vote for up to 3 engineers to go work on the oxygen recycler. Each player can only see who voted for the top 3 engineers at any given time. Players have 1.5 minutes to vote. Players can lock in their vote, and if all are locked in then remaining time is skipped.

Now, players are allowed to roam around the habitat, except for the oxygen recycler. Players can go into bedrooms and move furniture around to find asteroid shards (every person has a chance of having these in their room), or the escape code drive (they cannot see its contents). Players also have things they must do, such as use the bathroom, eat, or exercise. The game will force them to do these if they are about to run out of time to do it. If players are not in any rooms, they will be in the common area. Players in their own bedroom can lock the door, but doors can never be locked from the outside. Players in the same bedroom can whisper to each other.
The 3 engineers who were voted for have a choice of going to the oxygen recycler and finishing their task. They will never have another task they need to do, but they will never be forced to do this fix.
This section is 90 seconds long.

When the previous section is over, players will begin voting for the next team. Engineers who finished their task will be able to see how many tasks in the last fix were finished. The voting process is the same.

The same free roam period occurs for the same duration of time. This time, players who are whispering to each other can offer to defend them. This promise will not be broken. Players cannot offer if they have done it twice in a row. Sleeping players can never be killed if they have a defending player, unless the defending player is infected. If an attack was attempted, the defending player will see the names of those who could be responsible (the true infected will always be one of these). If the defending player has defended the night before, the number of names shown goes up. Dead players cannot talk.
Also during this free roam time, infected players can decide who they want to attack. If that person was defending someone else, then their room is free and can be searched. Two infected players cannot attack the same person, and infected cannot attack each other. Before an infected can attack someone, they must have slept once.

At any point in all this, players are allowed to talk in reality or whisper to the person next to them. They are not allowed to look at each other's devices.

The players must not fail half the possible repair tasks (if the current game needs 3 engineers per vote, then there are 5 days times 2 sections times 3 engineers per section possible tasks). If they do, the game proceeds to the next section.

## Escape
If the players do not have enough time to repair the oxygen recycler before they suffocate, they must use the escape pods. If the designated survivor is alive, they can view the escape codes at any point during this section, but they cannot show their device.

The rest of the players can only discuss in person what to do. Each player has 3 attempts at typing in the escape codes, after which they will not be able to escape. Players can escape at any time. There is a 3 minute time limit, after which all remaining non-infected will die. This time limit will be skipped if all players have used up their attempts.

Players who have escaped cannot talk.

## Oxygen Recycler Repaired
If the oxygen recycler is repaired, the game is ended for all non-infected, and the infected are revealed. At the same time, the infected have 2 minutes to escape. They also have 3 attempts. If they are unable to escape, they lose.

# Endings
# Great Ending
Oxygen Recycler is fixed with no infected escaping

# Good Ending
Oxygen Recycler could not be fixed, but all non-infected have escaped without any infected.

# Okay Ending
Oxygen Recycler could not be fixed, but some non-infected have escaped without any infected. Alternatively, the Oxygen Recycler was fixed but at least one infected escaped.

# Bad Ending
Oxygen Recycler could not be fixed, and at least one infected escaped, or no-one escaped.

For the infected, the ordering from best to worst is reversed.
